# Python Robo Speaker

## Overview
This Python script allows you to create a simple Robo speaker that repeats the command given to it. It uses text-to-speech functionality to speak out loud what you type into it.

## Features
- **Speech Output**: The script converts text input into speech output using Python's `pywin32` library.
- **Command Repeating**: Whatever command or text you type into the script, it repeats audibly.

## Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install `pywin32` using pip:
     ```
     pip install pywin32
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ali9463/Robo-Speaker-in-For-Window
   cd RoboSpeaker.py
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```
   python RoboSpeaker.py
   ```
   This will start the robo speaker program.

## Usage
- Type any command or text into the terminal where the script is running.
- The Robo speaker will repeat the text aloud using your system's default text-to-speech engine.
